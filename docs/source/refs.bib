abstract = {{A new wake model for isolated trees that combines theoretical and empirical features is developed for neutral atmospheric stability and implemented in the building-resolving Quick Environmental Simulation wind model (QES-Winds). The performance of this new model is evaluated in two ways. First, it is compared with published wind-tunnel data. The new model's velocity profiles have relative errors of less than 15\% for all cases at downwind distances larger than two element heights. Further evaluation is carried out using mean wind data from a suite of ten low-cost weather stations distributed throughout the University of Utah campus during a 19-day period. The new isolated-tree model yields good agreement with the observed wind direction and wind speed with root-mean-square-errors less than 1 m s−1 but with a small negative wind speed fractional bias (in and around isolated trees). In addition, comparisons among simulations without vegetation, with QES's standard canopy vegetation model, and the new isolated-tree model demonstrate that the impact of trees and tree wakes on the flow field is highly dependent on the proximity to buildings and building wakes in a complex urban environment.}},

The empirical relations were replaced by physical equations using flame geometry considerations, and the model now uses only two model parameters. It was tested and validated using a large set of laboratory and field scale experiments, carried out across fuel beds under different slope and wind conditions. Finally, the model was implemented as the physical core of a wildfire simulation tool for field scale fires and the case of a large wildfire was successfully treated as a first code evaluation."

The theoretical development is based on kinematic relationships between the velocity, vorticity, and heat release fields.

Very large area fires, such as those hypothesized in the Nuclear Winter scenario, are represented as ensembles of individual fires of differing strengths distributed over randomly chosen sites within the burning area. The experimental data for fire plumes over a four order of magnitude size range is compared with these calculations and previously developed plume velocity and temperature correlations."

abstract = "Several studies in the literature explore the connection between rate of spread (ROS) and wind in wildland fires. These studies show very different positions about the role of radiation and convection as heat transfer mechanisms. In the case when the fuel bed is well-ordered and vertically-oriented, there seems to be a consensus leading to suggest that convective heating is the dominant heat transfer mode in that case. The purpose of this work is to propose a convective semi-physical model for the behaviour of the rate of spread in wind, when the fuel bed is vertically-oriented. Due to a specific fuel bed arrangement, flame radiation –i.e. radiation from the part of the flame above the vegetal stratum– is neglected. Only horizontal radiation from the fuel burning particles area and convective heating are taken into account. Convective heat transfer is assumed to be the primary heat transfer mechanism. The proposed model is confronted to 172 laboratory fires with a wide range of fuel characteristics. The predicted results are also compared with two simplified models from the literature. Statistical tools are used to check the agreement between the predicted ROS and the observed one where a strong agreement is generally observed, irrespective of fuel bed characteristics."

abstract = "Studies of plumes from natural draft cooling towers have indicated that there is an underlying shortcoming in many of the integral plume models in the literature, which prevents them from simulta- neously predicting both plume trajectory and dilution rate accurately. Typically, if the entrainment constant(s) is chosen to yield trajectory predictions in good agreement with measurement, the corresponding dilution rate is overestimated and hence the visible length of a cooling tower plume is often greatly underestimated. By following the approaches of Slawson and Csanady (1971, J. Fluid Mech. 47, 33–49) and Briggs (1975, AMS) which lead to analytical expressions for plume variables, it is demonstrated that the inclusion of the resistive force of the atmosphere opposing the motion of the plume has a significant effect on model performance. For buoyancy dominated sources, the inclusion of this resistive or dynamic pressure force in the momentum balance, either through an added mass factor or through a drag term, allows trajectory predictions to be brought into agreement with measurements while the corresponding growth rate prediction is reduced. For momentum dominated sources, a reformulation of the initial condition for momentum flux, consistent with the assumptions of the integral analysis including the dynamic pressure force, is presented, and is also shown to reduce the entrainment rate required to match trajectory predictions to measurements. When this dynamic pressure force and modified initial momentum flux are included, simultaneous predictions of plume trajectory and growth rate obtained from a simple integral analysis are brought more into line with experimental data."

    abstract = {This study reports 3D numerical simulations of the ignition and the propagation of grassland fires. The mathematical model is based on a multiphase formulation and on a homogenization approach that consists in averaging the conservation equations (mass, momentum, energy …) governing the evolution of variables representing the state of the vegetation/atmosphere system, inside a control volume containing both the solid-vegetation phase and the surrounding gaseous phase. This preliminary operation results in the introduction of source/sink additional terms representing the interaction between the gaseous phase and the solid-fuel particles. This study was conducted at large scale in grassland because it represents the scale at which the behavior of the fire front presents most similarities with full scale wildfires and also because of the existence of a large number of relatively well controlled experiments performed in Australia and in the United States. The simulations were performed for a tall grass, on a flat terrain, and for six values of the 10-m open wind speed ranged between 1 and 12 m/s. The results are in fairly good agreement with experimental data, with the predictions of operational empirical and semi-empirical models, such as the McArthur model (MK5) in Australia and the Rothermel model (BEHAVE) in USA, as well as with the predictions of other fully 3D physical fire models (FIRETEC and WFDS). The comparison with the literature was mainly based on the estimation of the rate of fire spread (ROS) and of the fire intensity, as well as on the analysis of the fire-front shape.

    abstract = {Environmental conditions, such as fuel load and moisture levels, can influence the behaviour of wildfires. These factors are subject to natural small-scale variation which is usually spatially or temporally averaged for modelling fire propagation. The effect of including this variation in propagation models has not previously been fully examined or quantified. We investigate the effects of incorporating three types of variation on the shape and rate of propagation of a fire perimeter: variation in combustion conditions, wind direction and wind speed. We find that increasing the variation of combustion condition decreases the overall rate of propagation. An analytical model, based on the harmonic mean, is presented to explain this behaviour. Variation in wind direction is found to cause the development of rounded flanks due to cumulative chance of outward fluctuations at the sides of the perimeter. Our findings may be used to develop improved models for fire spread prediction.}

Although three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models have been successfully applied to wildfires, the computational time required makes them currently impractical for operational usage. In this study, we develop a two-dimensional propagation model coupled to a ‘pyrogenic’ potential flow formulation representing the inflow of air generated by the fire. This model can accurately replicate features of fires previously unable to be simulated using current two-dimensional models, including development of a fire line into a parabolic shape, attraction between nearby fires and the observed closing behaviour of ‘V’ shaped fires. The model is compared to experimental results with good agreement. The pyrogenic potential model is orders of magnitude faster than a full CFD model, and could be used for improved operational wildfire prediction.}

    abstract = {As scientists and managers seek to understand fire behavior in conditions that extend beyond the limits of our current empirical models and prior experiences, they will need new tools that foster a more mechanistic understanding of the processes driving fire dynamics and effects. Here we suggest that process-based models are powerful research tools that are useful for investigating a large number of emerging questions in wildland fire sciences. These models can play a particularly important role in advancing our understanding, in part, because they allow their users to evaluate the potential mechanisms and interactions driving fire dynamics and effects from a unique perspective not often available through experimentation alone. For example, process-based models can be used to conduct experiments that would be impossible, too risky, or costly to do in the physical world. They can also contribute to the discovery process by inspiring new experiments, informing measurement strategies, and assisting in the interpretation of physical observations. Ultimately, a synergistic approach where simulations are continuously compared to experimental data, and where experiments are guided by the simulations will profoundly impact the quality and rate of progress towards solving emerging problems in wildland fire sciences.},

    abstract = {This study was conducted to increase understanding of possible roles and importance of local three-dimensionality in the forward spread of wildfire models. A suite of simulations was performed using a coupled atmosphere–fire model, HIGRAD/FIRETEC, consisting of different scenarios that varied in domain width and boundary condition implementation. A subset of the simulations was strictly two-dimensional in the streamwise and vertical directions, while another subset of simulations involved igniting a finite-length fireline. The remaining simulations were all three-dimensional and employed periodic boundary conditions in the cross-stream direction and a fireline spanning the entire cross-stream extent of the domain. The three-dimensional periodic simulations were compared with the two-dimensional simulations, and then briefly with the finite-length fireline simulations. The two-dimensional scenarios were constrained in their ability to represent inherently three-dimensional physical phenomena such as horizontal flow penetrating through the fireline between plumes of rising hot gas, and cross-stream heterogeneity in the windfield. Elimination of these three-dimensional flow patterns in two-dimensional simulations resulted in over prediction of spread rates in low velocity situations and under predicted spread rates in high wind speed scenarios. In the three-dimensional simulations, local cross-stream heterogeneities in temperature and velocities lead to penetration of hot gases through the fireline and onto unburned fuel. Three-dimensional fires presented a positive correlation between increasing ambient wind speed and rate of spread. Further investigation of finite length fires is required in order to understand the ramifications of fireline curvature.}

Multiple research tools linking combustion to fluid flow use Navier-Stokes numerical solutions coupled to a thermodynamic model to understand fire-atmospheric feedbacks, but these computational fluid dynamics approaches require high-performance computing resources. We present a new simulation tool called QUIC-Fire to rapidly solve these feedbacks by coupling the mature 3-D rapid wind solver QUIC-URB to a physics-based cellular automata fire spread model Fire-CA. QUIC-Fire uses 3-D fuels inputs similar to the CFD model FIRETEC, allowing this tool to simulate effects of fuel structure on local winds and fire behavior. Results comparing fire behavior metrics to the computational fluid dynamic model FIRETEC show strong agreement. QUIC-Fire is the first tool intended to provide an opportunity for prescribed fire planners to compare, evaluate, and design burn plans, including complex ignition patterns and coupled fire-atmospheric feedbacks."

ABSTRACT = {Forecasting fire growth, plume rise and smoke impacts on air quality remains a challenging task. Wildland fires dynamically interact with the atmosphere, which can impact fire behavior, plume rises, and smoke dispersion. For understory fires, the fire propagation is driven by winds attenuated by the forest canopy. However, most numerical weather prediction models providing meteorological forcing for fire models are unable to resolve canopy winds. In this study, an improved canopy model parameterization was implemented within a coupled fire-atmosphere model (WRF-SFIRE) to simulate a prescribed burn within a forested plot. Simulations with and without a canopy wind model were generated to determine the sensitivity of fire growth, plume rise, and smoke dispersion to canopy effects on near-surface wind flow. Results presented here found strong linkages between the simulated fire rate of spread, heat release and smoke plume evolution. The standard WRF-SFIRE configuration, which uses a logarithmic interpolation to estimate sub-canopy winds, overestimated wind speeds (by a factor 2), fire growth rates and plume rise heights. WRF-SFIRE simulations that implemented a canopy model based on a non-dimensional wind profile, saw significant improvements in sub-canopy winds, fire growth rates and smoke dispersion when evaluated with observations.},

abstract = {Wildland fire radiant energy emission is one of the only measurements of combustion that can be made at wide spatial extents and high temporal and spatial resolutions. Furthermore, spatially and temporally explicit measurements are critical for making inferences about fire effects and useful for examining patterns of fire spread. In this study we describe our methods for capturing and analysing spatially and temporally explicit long-wave infrared (LWIR) imagery from the RxCADRE (Prescribed Fire Combustion and Atmospheric Dynamics Research Experiment) project and examine the usefulness of these data in investigating fire behaviour and effects. We compare LWIR imagery captured at fine and moderate spatial and temporal resolutions (from 1 cm2 to 1 m2; and from 0.12 to 1 Hz) using both nadir and oblique measurements. We analyse fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of fire radiant power and energy released in several experimental burns. There was concurrence between the measurements, although the oblique view estimates of fire radiative power were consistently higher than the nadir view estimates. The nadir measurements illustrate the significance of fuel characteristics, particularly type and connectivity, in driving spatial variability at fine scales. The nadir and oblique measurements illustrate the usefulness of the data for describing the location and movement of the fire front at discrete moments in time at these fine and moderate resolutions. Spatially and temporally resolved data from these techniques show promise to effectively link the combustion environment with post-fire processes, remote sensing at larger scales and wildland fire modelling efforts.},

Fuel loading and fuel consumption averaged 6.8 and 4.1 Mg ha–1 respectively in the forest units and 3.0 and 2.2 Mg ha–1 in the non-forest units. Post-fire white ash cover ranged from 1 to 28\%. Data were used to evaluate two fuel consumption models, CONSUME and FOFEM, and to develop regression equations for predicting fuel consumption from ash cover. CONSUME and FOFEM produced similar predictions of total fuel consumption and were comparable with measured values. Simple linear models to predict pre-fire fuel loading and fuel consumption from post-fire white ash cover explained 46 and 59\% of variation respectively.}

abstractNote = {Prediction of the 3-dimensional flow field around buildings and other obstacles is important for a number of applications, including urban air quality studies, the tracking of plumes from accidental releases of toxic air contaminants, indoor/outdoor air pollution problems, and thermal comfort assessments. Various types of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models have been used for determining the flow fields around buildings (e.g., Reisner et al., 1998; Eichhorn et al., 1988). Comparisons to measurements show that these models work reasonably well for the most part (e.g., Ehrhard et al., 2 ; Johnson and Hunter, 1998; Murakami, 1997). However, CFD models are computationally intensive and for some applications turn-around time is of the essence. For example, planning and assessment studies in which hundreds of cases must be analyzed or emergency response scenarios in which plume transport must be computed quickly. Several fast-response dispersion models of varying levels of fidelity have been developed to explicitly account for the effects of a single building or groups of buildings (e.g., UDM - Hall et al. (2000), NRC-Ramsdell and Fosmire (1995), CBP-3 - Yamartino and Wiegand (1986), APRAC - Daerdt et al. (1973)). Although a few of these models include the Hotchkiss and Harlow (1973) analytical solution for potential flow in a notch to describe the velocity field within an urban canyon, in general, these models do not explicitly compute the velocity field around groups of buildings. The EPA PRIME model (Schulman et al., 2000) has been empirically derived to provide streamlines around a single isolated building.},

abstract = {The winds generated at 11:45 a.m. by 38 fires and at 12:00 p.m. by 259 fires for the Oakland Hills Fire are simulated using plume models. The results for a Baum and McCaffrey single plume are compared with those for a Zukoski model. For an exemplar 50 MW house, the flame tip is 15 m high, the maximum vertical velocity is 16 m/sec and the maximum radial velocity is 2.35 m/sec. A 1 GW mass fire produces a 78 m flame tip, a maximum vertical velocity of 37 m/sec and a maximum radial velocity of 5.3 m/sec. The two models compared well in the far field. The Baum and McCaffrey mass fire model is applied between the ground level and the independent plume ceiling. Four superposition methodologies are explored. The computational domain is divided into equal area sectors. The four methods employ different techniques to perform the inner sum (the direct sum over adjacent sectors surrounding a data point) and the exterior sum for fires located outside this set. The primary method used here calculates a single set of average characteristic scales which act at a sector's centroid. It compares well with more exact methods, achieving run times typically less than one minute. At 11:45 a.m., the maximum induced wind is 2.6 m/sec based on a 40 point grid. The maximum vertical velocity is 14 m/sec based on a 2,600 point grid. At 12:00 p.m., the maximum horizontal velocity is 13 m/sec based on a 40 point grid. The maximum vertical velocity is 26 m/sec based on a 72,900 point grid. Results indicate that the strong fire-induced winds at 12:00 p.m. contributed to the post-noon fire decrease in the fire spread rate. The Euroka fire demonstrates some mass fire modeling limitations. A resultant fire plume emerges from a multiple fire scenario after the convective columns have coalesced. This is modeled using a two shift, modified Baum and McCaffrey plume. Conservation of mass and momentum give implicit relations for the two shifts. The first shift is applied to axial quantities while the second shift affects the plume radius. Two example 50 MW plumes, spaced 152 m apart, yield a virtual origin for the center-line shift that is 587 m below ground level while that for the radius is 240 m below ground level. The resultant plume is wider than any single plume and its profiles are less. Two types of circular plume arrays demonstrate the characteristics of resultant plumes. The results for the Oakland Hills Fire are consistent with known observations.},
