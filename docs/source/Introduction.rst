Introduction
============

A new dispersion modeling system based on the well-used FORTRAN-based
QUIC (Quick Urban and Industrial Complex) dispersion modeling system
originally developed by the University of Utah and Los Alamos National
Laboratory :cite:`brown2013quic`, has been under development as
collaboration between the University of Utah, the University of
Minnesota, Duluth and Pukyong National University. Quick Environmental
Simulation (QES) is a microclimate simulation platform for computing 3D
environmental scalars in urban areas and over complex terrain. The
modules are the following:
